 This is basically an app that helps users to sort the order in which they view movies, upon clicking a movie
 you get to see details about the movie. They can also favourite a movie and the details of the movie will be saved to a databade for easy retrieval with or without internet connection
 
 
 
 
### Prerequisites

For developers, you will have to generate your own api key from the moviedb api
